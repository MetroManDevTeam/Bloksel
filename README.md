# Welcome to the Bloksel Project!
## Project under development the first stable release we'll be announced, do not clone yet

A voxel-based game engine written in Rust, featuring a block-based world with advanced terrain generation, physics, and rendering capabilities. Bloksel expands on the idea of an **unlimited voxel engine**, designed to push the boundaries of creativity and performance.

## Features

- **Block-based world system** with support for **sub-blocks** for finer detail  
- **Advanced terrain generation** with biomes, caves, and dynamic ecosystems  
- **Efficient chunk-based world management** with **rendering optimizations**  
- **Physics system** for realistic player and block interactions  
- **Modern OpenGL-based rendering pipeline** for stunning visuals  
- **Ultra performance enhancements** to handle vast, seamless worlds  
- **Configurable world generation parameters** for tailored experiences  

## Vision  

Bloksel is more than a game—it’s a platform to recreate:  
- **Game scenarios**  
- **Movie scenes**  
- **Real-world environments** and beyond!  

Currently in **prototype stage**, this project offers a glimpse of what’s to come: **limitless imagination!** Our final goal is to evolve into a **multiplayer voxel game**, but we’ll need **funding** to implement multiplayer or enter a **secret phase** of development. For inquiries, reach out to `MetroManSR`.  

## Requirements  

- Rust 1.70 or higher  
- OpenGL 4.3 or higher  
- CMake 3.10 or higher (for some dependencies)
