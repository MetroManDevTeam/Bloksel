### Work in progress, we'll announce when prototype is ready for distribution

# **🌌 Bloksel - Real Terrain Voxel Game**  
*Source Code | [GitHub](https://github.com/MetroManSR/Bloksel)*  

A voxel-based game engine written in Rust, featuring **1:1 scale planet terrains** with advanced fractal generation and dynamic LOD systems. Bloksel pushes the boundaries of voxel technology for limitless creativity.

## **✨ Core Features:**  
- **Planet-scale 1:1 voxel worlds** with realistic terrain  
- **Fractal terrain generation** with biomes and dynamic ecosystems  
- **1/8 Cube Size** for finer detail than traditional voxel engines  
- **Dynamic LOD & chunk streaming** for seamless infinite worlds  
- **Modern Vulkan-based rendering** with optimized pipeline  
- **Configurable world generation** for tailored experiences  

## **🖥️ Platforms:**  
✅ Windows (Primary)  
✅ Linux (Planned)  
🔄 macOS (Post-launch)  
📱 Mobile/Web (Future)  

## **🚧 Development Status:**  
Currently in **prototype stage** with core engine development ongoing.  

## **🚀 Roadmap:**  
1. Core engine (Current Focus)  
2. Advanced terrain generation  
3. Physics and player systems  
4. Multiplayer support (Requires funding)  

## **🛠️ Building**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MetroManSR/Bloksel.git
cd Bloksel
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
```

## **📂 Project Structure**  
- `src/world/` - Planet-scale world management  
- `src/render/` - LOD rendering pipeline  
- `src/terrain/` - Fractal generation systems  
- `src/player/` - Physics and controls  
- `src/assets/` - Resource management  

## **💡 Vision**  
More than a game engine - a platform to recreate:  
- Game scenarios • Movie scenes • Real-world environments
